**Notes from Aug 26**

Class goes over pointers and memory addresses.

Fig2-4 as of first two commits primarily contains the address of its variables and outputs that address.

Alternatively, Fig2-5 outputs both the memory address _and_ the variables stored in that memory address.

**Third Commit**

Added swap pointer code form bb.
